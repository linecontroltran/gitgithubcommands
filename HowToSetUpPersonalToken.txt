Make the token

then download 

git credential manager (GCM)

brew install --casl git-credential-manager

make a repo on github

try to push something to it.

it will ask you to authenticate.

try and use the personal access token and input this into the modal that pops up.

do not use your username/password for github

use your token.

from now and on it should work without having to enter in a password each and everytime

and also you do not have to authorize the modal for each repository.
